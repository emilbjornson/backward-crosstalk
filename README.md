## Abstract of Article

We consider backward crosstalk in 2 x 2 transmitters, which is caused by crosstalk from the outputs of the transmitter to the inputs or by the combination of output crosstalk and impedance mismatch. We analyze its impact via feedback networks together with third-order power amplifier non-linearities. We utilize the Bussgang decomposition to express the distorted output signals of the transmitter as a linear transformation of the input plus uncorrelated distortion. The normalized mean-square errors (NMSEs) between the distorted and desired amplified signals are expressed analytically and the optimal closed-form power back-off that minimizes the worst NMSE of the two branches is derived. In the second part of the paper, an achievable spectral efficiency (SE) is presented for the communication from this “dirty” transmitter to another single-antenna receiver. The SE-maximizing precoder is optimally found by exploiting the hardware characteristics. Furthermore, the optimal power back-off is analyzed for two sub-optimal precoders, which either do not exploit any hardware knowledge or only partial knowledge. The simulation results show that the performance of these sub-optimal precoders is close-to-optimal. We also discuss how the analysis in this paper can be extended to transmitters with an arbitrary number of antenna branches.
